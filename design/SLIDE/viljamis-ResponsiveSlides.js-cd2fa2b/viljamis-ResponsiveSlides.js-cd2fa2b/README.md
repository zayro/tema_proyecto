# ResponsiveSlides.js 
### Responsive slideshow plugin that weights under 1kb

[ResponsiveSlides.js](http://responsive-slides.viljamis.com/) is a tiny jQuery plugin that creates a responsive slideshow using images inside a single container. It work with wide range of browsers including all IE versions from IE6 and up. It also adds css max-width support for IE6 and other browsers that don't natively support it. Only dependency is [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and that all the images are same size.

Biggest difference to other responsive slideshow plugins is the file size (792 bytes minified and gzipped) + that this one doesn't try to do everything. ResponsiveSlides.js has basically only two different modes: Either it just automatically fades the images, or operates as a responsive image container with pagination to navigate/fade between slides.
