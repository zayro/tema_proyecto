* Added `teardown` event for effective reversal of initialization and to pair `setup`.
* As of this release the minimal version of jQuery has been increased to *1.4.x*.

Version 1.0.3
-------------
* User *neptune* (thanks!) found a nasty mishap where option `tooltip` was used instead of `hint` on several places. To stay backwards compatibile `tooltip` will stay as an alias of new option `hint` (which is preferred).
