<!--
Are you using HTML5 yet ? nope ?
Ok then, I'll show you some quick things that you can
start implementing right today. Let's start by pasting
some xhtml code below.

So, what you see now is some xhtml code with the xHTML
Strict Doctype. Let's convert it into valid HTML5 code.

1. We will start by getting rid of the big doctype first.
That's the HTML5 Doctype (short and simple) :)
2. Next, we will get rid of xml namespace and other xml
attributes from the html element.
3. HTML5 gives us a new way to mention the document charset.
4. We can get rid of the type="text/css" and
type="text/javascript" from link, style and script tags!

As you can see, the code has become much shorter and
cleaner. Our filesize will be smaller and the amount of bytes
transfered when a user visits our website will be less too!

One last thing though, HTML5 defines an HTML syntax that is
compatible with HTML4 and XHTML1 documents published on the
Web. So we can actually get rid of backslash (/) from our
existing self closing tags like
<img src="" alt="" />
So <br /> becomes <br>
Let's make the appropriate changes in the code.

Oops, forgot to remove the old meta charset tag before :)

That's all. Start using these basic HTML5 features right today.
We can discuss more in the comments :)
