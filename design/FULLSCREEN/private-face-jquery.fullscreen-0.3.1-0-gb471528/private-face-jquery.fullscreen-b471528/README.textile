h1. jQuery.fullscreen

jQuery.fullscreen allows you to open any element on the page in fullscreen mode without using Flash in all modern browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera). If this feature is not supported by the browser then element will be just stretched to fill the screen without switching to fullscreen.

"Fullscreen API":http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/fullscreen/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#api is natively supported in Chrome 15+, Safari 5.1+, Firefox 10+ and Opera 12.1+. It is also present in Firefox 9.0, but it is disabled by default. You can be enable it by setting @fullscreen-api.enabled@ to @true@ in @about:config@.

h2. Usage

h3. Request/exit fullscreen

<pre><code><div id="some_selector">
	Block to be displayed in fullscreen.
</div>

<script>
	// open element in fullscreen
	$('#some_selector').fullscreen(options);
	// close fullscreen
	$.fullscreen.exit();
</script>
</code></pre>

Currently the following options are supported:
* @overflow {'hidden'}@: 'overflow' css-property, which is set to an element when it is being opened in fullscreen;
* @toggleClass {null}@: class name which is toggled when an element changes its 'fullscreen' state;
* @documentScroll {false}@: set this options to @true@ if you want to allow document's scroll when fullscreen mode is active.

h3. $.fullscreen object methods

* @$.fullscreen.open(element[, options])@: equivalent to @$(element).fullscreen(options)@;
* @$.fullscreen.exit()@: exit fullscreen mode;
* @$.fullscreen.isNativelySupported() {true|false}@: returns @true@ if browser supports Fullscreen API natively;
* @$.fullscreen.isFullScreen() {true|false}@: returns @true@ if there is an element opened in fullscreen.

h3. Events

h4. fscreenchange

* jQuery.Event object

@fscreenopen@ and @fscreenclose@ events are sent to an element when it's being opened in fullscreen (or exited fullscreen mode).
